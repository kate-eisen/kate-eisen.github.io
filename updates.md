Finally, finally starting my postdoc at Lund University! Very excited to be working with Magne Friberg, Anna Runemark, and the rest of the team to try to figure out why there is so much variation in the floral scent of <i>Arabis alpina</i>. Looking forward to learning genomics and transcriptomics and hopefully spending a lot of time in the Alps next field season! <br>
  <br>
  In other exciting news, a paper I co-authored from a collaboration that was in the works for a long time is now out in <i>Theoretical Ecology</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00478-3">here</a>. We demonstrate how the Price Equation can be used to estimate biodiversity change in communities.

I'm very excited to say that the fourth publication from my dissertation work is now available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/715501">here</a>, in early view at <i>The American Naturalist</i>! In this manuscript I provide evidence for character displacement in floral scent in <i>Clarkia</i>.

The third publication from my dissertation work is now out in an issue at <i>Evolution</i>! This project was a multi-year study that examines how community context shapes selection on floral traits in <i>Clarkia</i>. You can check out the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13960">here</a>, and a digest that was written about the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14055">here</a>.

ECR^2, an online meeting organized by grad students from ASN, SSE, and SSB, is happening! I've been working on a few of the events as well as overall logistics. The website for the meeting is linked <a href="https://www.evolutionmeetings.org">here</a>, and it provides a schedule. Recordings of most events will be available on YouTube (see meeting website) if you missed an event.

I defended my Ph.D.! A big thank you to my committee members for their support, and to my friends and family in & out of academia who zoomed into my virtual defense and made it a lot of fun! <br> <br>
  I submitted a manuscript that provides evidence for character displacement in floral scent in <i>Clarkia</i>! It's available now on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.022004">bioRxiv</a>. <br>

I received an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology! I'll be working with Magne Friberg and Anna Runemark at Lund University on genomic & ecological factors that contribute to variation in the floral scent of <i>Arabis alpina</i> across Europe. <br>
  <br>
  In early March, before everything shut down, I went on a super fun trip to Philadelphia, where I presented two seminars (the BEES grad seminar at Drexel, and the Academy seminar series at the Natural Academy). I also got to see *the original Clarkia*, the specimen collected on the Lewis and Clark expedition! The note on the type specimen (<i>Clarkia pulchella</i>) says "A beautiful herbaceous plant" --agree!

The second publication from my dissertation is out in a special issue on floral trait evolution in the <i>International Journal of Plant Sciences</i>! This paper documents the results of a huge flowering time manipulation study that I performed in Kern County in 2016. The full text is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/705607">here</a>.

I went to two amazing meetings back to back: Evolution in Providence, RI and the 43rd New Phytologist Symposium, which was centered around species interactions and trait evolution and took place in Zurich, Switzerland. In addition to all of the great science, I loved seeing the species-rich plant communities of the Swiss Alps--can't wait to get back there!

I'm excited to be a TA for Chemical Ecology this semester! Looking forward to getting students curious about the roles that chemistry plays in many systems, from plants & insects to marine inverts! I'll be giving a guest lecture on the chemical ecology of invasive species, as part of the final segment of the course, Chemical Ecology in the Anthropocene. <br> <br>
  
Our meta-analysis of experimental studies of selection on floral traits is out in an issue at <i>Evolution</i>! This has been a long-time collaboration with Chris Caruso (University of Guelph), Ryan Martin (Case Western University), and Nina Sletvold (Uppsala University). You can check out the full text <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13639">here</a> .

The first publication from my dissertation is out in an issue at <i>Journal of Evolutionary Biology</i>. This study uses data from species co-occurrence mapping and a greenhouse common garden to address whether <i>Clarkia</i> communities are shaped by ecological sorting and character displacement. The full text is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13365">here</a> . <br> <br>
  
  I published a digest in <i>Evolution</i> about a recent paper that uses an experimental evolution approach to explore how generalized pollination evolves. You can check it out <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13638">here</a>.

I presented at the joint SSE-ESEB Evolution meeting in Montpellier, France! I enjoyed connecting with the European pollination biology/floral trait evolution community, and of course, many croissants.

Headed back to the southern Sierra foothills for a short field project looking at linking variation in flower size to variation in the abiotic environment, plant biomass, and physiology. This was in collaboration with my great friend Ellie Goud, and we had a lot of fun taking soil cores, measuring plants, and soaking in the local flora.
