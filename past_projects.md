         <b> Pollen presentation: </b> Plants have evolved many mechanisms that promote pollen export and transfer via animal pollinators. One such mechanism is pollen dispensing, where plants regulate the amount of pollen available to a pollinator during a single visit. But in order for pollen dispensing to evolve, there must be variation in dispensing schedules within populations, and this variation must have a heritable component. We measured variation in pollen dispensing schedules for ten open-pollinated maternal families within a population of <i>Lobelia siphilitica</i> (Campanulaceae). <br> <br> 
         We found that <i>L. siphilitica</i> flowers dispensed an average of 8.76 % +/- 1.37 % of available pollen during any visit, which is low relative to other measured species. We found that the repeatability, which places an upper limit on the heritability of a trait, was 0.29, which suggests there could be constraints on the evolution of constant or increasing proportional pollination schedules. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/688961">doi</a>

   <b> Forest ecology: </b> The majority of forested ecosystems in the northeastern U.S. are second-growth stands that established following the abandonment of agricultural fields in the mid-to-late 1800s. Repeated measurements of these forests provide an opportunity to assess how change in northeastern forests impacts the globally significant carbon sinks documented in the region; the capacity for storage may change over decades to centuries with stand-level changes in age, species composition, and structure, and these long-term processes are not well represented in current models of carbon sequestration. <br> <br>
   Using 42 years of census data for > 6,000 individual trees in a 2.9-ha permanent plot at the Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA, USA), we found that the biomass of live trees increased linearly, confirming that this ca. 110-year-old stand is still in the aggradation phase of stand development. Quercus rubra L. (red oak) accounts for 80 percent of the increase in aboveground biomass due to the rapid growth of dominant stems and low canopy mortality rates, and we predict this dominance will continue over the next century, in the absence of major canopy disturbance.
