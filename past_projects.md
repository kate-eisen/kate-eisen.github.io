         Plants have evolved many mechanisms that promote pollen export and transfer via animal pollinators. One such mechanism is pollen dispensing, where plants regulate the amount of pollen available to a pollinator during a single visit. But in order for pollen dispensing to evolve, there must be variation in dispensing schedules within populations, and this variation must have a heritable component. We measured variation in pollen dispensing schedules for ten open-pollinated maternal families within a population of <i>Lobelia siphilitica</i> (Campanulaceae). <br> We found that <i>L. siphilitica</i> flowers dispensed an average of 8.76 % +/- 1.37 % of available pollen during any visit, which is low relative to other measured species. We found that the repeatability, which places an upper limit on the heritability of a trait, was 0.29, which suggests there could be constraints on the evolution of constant or increasing proportional pollination schedules.
