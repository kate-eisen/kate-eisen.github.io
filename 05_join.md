Please reach out to Dr. Eisen via email (katherine dot eisen @ lmu dot edu) or come drop by her office on the third floor of the Featherston Life Sciences Building.
Depending on the size of the lab and the nature of the current projects, opportunities may exist at any point in the year--do not hesitate to get in touch.
LMU's Biology Department does not host Masters or PhD students, but Dr. Eisen is available to serve on graduate students' committees--please reach out if you are interested.
