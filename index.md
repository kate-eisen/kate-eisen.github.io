## *I am an evolutionary ecologist.*


I use flowers as a nexus for asking questions in ecology and evolutionary biology across scales of biological organization, from genomics and plant metabolism to community dynamics and large-scale meta-analyses. I'm currently working on the genomic underpinnings and ecological drivers of complex trait variation in an artic-alpine perennial in mountainous areas across Europe with Magne Friberg & Anna Runemark at Lund University. I did my Ph.D. research on the effects of community context on evolution in annual wildflower communities in the southern Sierra Nevada foothills in California with Monica Geber at Cornell University. As a research associate with Chris Caruso at the University of Guelph, I worked on projects investigating the evolution of sexual systems in plants using a perennial herb common in wet meadows in eastern North America.

New paper out in <i>Functional Ecology</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13970">here</a>! This was something I worked on with my lab at Cornell starting in spring 2020 and that we carried on during lockdown, so it is super exciting to see it come out.

I just got back from a short but sweet trip to the French Alps to check out some populations of <i>Arabis alpina </i> that might be part of our 2022 field campaign. It was awesome to see the plants on the slopes of the Alps at elevations around 2,500 meters, and I had a great time at the lovely Jardin du Lautaret.

Finally, finally starting my postdoc at Lund University! Very excited to be working with Magne Friberg, Anna Runemark, and the rest of the team to try to figure out why there is so much variation in the floral scent of <i>Arabis alpina</i>. Looking forward to learning genomics and transcriptomics and hopefully spending a lot of time in the Alps next field season! <br>

  In other exciting news, a paper I co-authored from a collaboration that was in the works for a long time is now out in <i>Theoretical Ecology</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-020-00478-3">here</a>. We demonstrate how the Price Equation can be used to estimate biodiversity change in communities.

I'm very excited to say that the fourth publication from my dissertation work is now available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/715501">here</a>, in early view at <i>The American Naturalist</i>! In this manuscript I provide evidence for character displacement in floral scent in <i>Clarkia</i>.

The third publication from my dissertation work is now out in an issue at <i>Evolution</i>! This project was a multi-year study that examines how community context shapes selection on floral traits in <i>Clarkia</i>. You can check out the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13960">here</a>, and a digest that was written about the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14055">here</a>.
