My research program seeks to understand the factors that contribute to differentiation in floral traits across biological scales, from genomics to community dynamics.

To address my questions, I use a diversity of tools (high throughput chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds, geometric morphometrics, stable isotope analysis, and comparative genomics and transcriptomics) and approaches (field experiments, greenhouse common gardens, meta-analyses). 

As a *postdoc* with Magne Friberg and Anna Runemark at Lund University, 

My *Ph.D work* focused on x and y.
